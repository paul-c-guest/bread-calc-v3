# Good Leavening

## bread calculator v3

a bread dough hydration calculator specifically targeted at sourdough users. 

blending different ratios of flours for every new loaf makes it difficult to arrive at a desired dough hydration, leading to disappointments in the kitchen!

### this version

using just HTML / CSS and Javascript for DOM manipulation. Started during the Foundations portion of Dev Academy (July 2023) as an attempt to implement the add/remove flour feature with vanilla JS. The CSS styling used in v4 was mostly nailed down in this version also.

### previous versions
